            Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining
            websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing,
            web programming, and database management. While the terms "web
            developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, they do
            not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs
            website interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be
            involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in
            languages such as PHP and ASP.
